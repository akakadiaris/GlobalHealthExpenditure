    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe allocation and trends in health spending wield profound implications for the well-being of nations. Timely and accurate information on health expenditure is crucial for preparing and responding to health emergencies, including pandemics. It enables countries and international organizations to allocate resources strategically, strengthen healthcare infrastructure, and enhance preparedness measures. This information is also vital for assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of health services, identifying areas for improvement, and achieving better health outcomes. Finally, estimates of future health spending can be beneficial for policymakers and planners and can identify financing gaps.\nThis project delves into the realm of visualizing and comprehending the dynamics of Global Health Spending—a subject of paramount importance often obscured in the complexity of its vast dataset. The decision to explore this topic is rooted in the imperative to unravel patterns, disparities, and trends shaping how countries invest in the health and well-being of their populations. To do so, we leverage two comprehensive datasets containing health expenditure data for 204 countries from 1995 to 2019, and 2020 to 2050, produced by the Global Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network. These datasets encompasses a myriad of components, from government contributions and out-of-pocket expenses to development assistance and prepaid private financing. This holistic perspective on health spending transcends individual borders, offering insights into the global landscape of healthcare economics.\nThe questions propelling this inquiry are as diverse as the facets of health spending itself. Seeking to bring clarity to this complexity, this research aims to address critical queries that traverse the temporal, geographical, financial source and future dimensions of health expenditure. Therefore, we will focus on the following four themes: Trends in Global Health Spending Over Time, Geographic Disparities, Health Spending by Financing Source, and Global Health Spending Patterns 2020 to 2050.\nTrends in Global Health Spending Over Time\nThe first trajectory of inquiry delves into the temporal evolution of global health spending, exploring changes from 1995 to 2019. Questions arise: Are there discernible trends or patterns in health spending over this span of time? How has total global health spending transformed, and what insights can be gleaned from the observed trends? Another avenue we explore is investigating the impact of major global events (e.g., pandemics) on health spending across different regions. Can patterns or anomalies be identified in health spending during significant events, providing valuable insights into global healthcare resilience?\nGeographic Disparities\nA second avenue of exploration navigates the disparities in health spending across diverse regions or continents. This prompts an examination of variations: Do certain regions consistently outpace others in health spending? Are there observable disparities that unveil regional predilections in healthcare investment? How do low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries compare in terms of health spending trends over time?\nHealth Spending by Financing Source\nMoving further, the research scrutinizes the sources fueling health spending. How much comes from government allocations, out-of-pocket expenses, and prepaid private sources? How have these proportions changed globally over time? We aim to paint a nuanced picture of the financial architecture sustaining healthcare systems.\nGlobal Health Spending Patterns 2020 to 2050\nLastly, we focus on the future. The data from the Global Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network projected health spending estimates for 2020 to 2050 for 204 countries and territories. We analyze total health spending from the perspective of the previously discussed three themes, spending patterns over time, geographic disparities, along with disaggregated spending by source (government, out-of-pocket, and prepaid private). We aim to compare past trends with predicted trends to gain valuable insights based on the previously discussed themes.\nComparing Over Time Patterns: How do total health spending patterns evolve from 1995 to 2050, considering both historical data and future predictions? What insights can be gained by visually comparing past and predicted health spending patterns through a line chart spanning the years 1995-2050?\nComparing Geographic Disparities: How do total health spending patterns vary geographically in 1995, 2019, and the projected year 2050? Are there notable changes in geographic disparities over time, and how do they align with global health trends? In what regions do significant disparities persist or emerge, and how might these impact future health outcomes?\nComparing Health Spending by Financing Source: How do government, out-of-pocket, and prepaid private health spending categories compare over time, integrating both historical and future perspectives? What shifts in the proportions of financing sources are anticipated from 1995 to 2050, and how might they influence overall health expenditure?\nIntegrated Comparison: Time, Geography, and Total Health Spending: How does the integrated comparison of health spending trends over time, geographic regions, and financing sources contribute to a holistic understanding of global health economics?\nConclusion\nIn summary, this research endeavors to narrow the divide between raw data and nuanced comprehension, cultivating a holistic perspective on the determinants shaping investments in inclusive and enduring health systems on a global scale. Our intent is to pinpoint critical areas where the health economy may exhibit vulnerabilities in the face of potential forthcoming global challenges. Emphasizing the significance of meticulously tracking health expenditure, we illuminate anticipated challenges on the horizon."

    "section": "2.3 Missing value analysis",
    "text": "2.3 Missing value analysis\nAs a whole, the data seems to be very clean. Upon thorough scrutiny of the data set, it becomes apparent that a singular column, the column titled “iso3,” has missing data. This column had 100 missing values, while all the other columns had no missing information.\n\nThese missing values, however, are not indicative of a flaw or oversight but rather a deliberate design choice in alignment with the dataset’s prescribed structure.The “iso3” column serves as a repository for three-letter country codes, crucial for country-specific identification. Upon closer inspection, it is discernible that certain rows within this column intentionally lack values. The rows that have missing is03 values correspond to values High income, Low income, Lower-middle income, and Upper-middle income in “location_name” column. This intentional omission is justified by consulting the dataset’s documentation, where it is explicitly stated that these specific entries do not correspond to any particular country.\n\nInstead, these instances are intended to encapsulate broader, non-country-specific information or aggregates that do not require a specific country code. In essence, the intentional missing values in the “iso3” column serve as placeholders for entries that transcend the bounds of individual countries, reflecting a nuanced data structure designed to accommodate diverse information categories within the dataset.\nThat being said, after taking a closer look at the data, we noticed that there are “-” or O inserted as some values.\nThose columns that have missing values and how many there are are:\nwith - values: ppp_total_mean 86\nppp_total_lower 400\nppp_total_upper 75 ppp_total_ppp_mean 83\nppp_total_ppp_lower 386 ppp_total_ppp_upper 77\noop_total_lower 25 oop_total_ppp_lower 25\ndah_total_mean 399\ndah_total_ppp_mean 399\nwith “0” values: dah_total_mean 1000 dah_total_ppp_mean 1000 ghes_per_cap_mean 9\nghes_per_cap_lower 17\nghes_per_cap_upper 5\nppp_per_cap_mean 747 ppp_per_cap_lower 928\nppp_per_cap_upper 633\nppp_per_cap_ppp_mean 599 ppp_per_cap_ppp_lower 692 ppp_per_cap_ppp_upper 510 oop_per_cap_mean 25 oop_per_cap_lower 25\noop_per_cap_upper 12\noop_per_cap_ppp_mean 25 oop_per_cap_ppp_lower 25\noop_per_cap_ppp_upper 19\ndah_per_cap_mean 1857\ndah_per_cap_ppp_mean 1700\nppp_per_the_mean 497\nppp_per_the_lower 499 ppp_per_the_upper 460 oop_per_the_mean 25\noop_per_the_lower 25\noop_per_the_upper 25\ndah_per_the_mean 1654\ndah_per_the_lower 1660\ndah_per_the_upper 1648\nppp_per_gdp_mean 965 ppp_per_gdp_lower 1237\nppp_per_gdp_upper 800 oop_per_gdp_mean 25\noop_per_gdp_lower 25\noop_per_gdp_upper 25\ndah_per_gdp_mean 2555\ndah_per_gdp_lower 2591\ndah_per_gdp_upper 2537\nBelow are two bar graphs with this information illustrated.\n \nWhen looking at the data, each country has 25 rows of data (corresponding to years). So the variables in which the cases of - or 0 being 25, that is that one countries values have missing data. That then got us thinking about the looking at each location_name by itself and seeing if the missing values for each of those rows is the same or different. It turns out that, for different years, the amount of values that are - or 0 for each location, might not be the same.\nThat being said, we decided against doing any imputation and we decided that we would convert any values that are - or 0 into 0. Since there is no case where the geniune value for any of the countries should be 0, we would not have to worry about misinterpretation."

    "title": "2  Data",
    "section": "2.1 Technical Description",
    "text": "2.1 Technical Description\nData Format and Collection\nThe data collection process involved multiple sources, with a primary focus on the World Health Organization’s Global Health Expenditure Database (GHED), a reputable repository compiling global health expenditure information. Additionally, data for development assistance for health (DAH) were sourced from various outlets, including program reports, budget data, national estimates, and National Health Accounts (NHAs). Domestic health spending sources, encompassing government, out-of-pocket, and prepaid private health spending, primarily relied on data from the WHO’s GHED. For countries not covered by GHED, information was extracted from respective country ministries of health or finance websites.\nAssessment of GHED-extracted data reliability involved scrutinizing metadata provided by the World Health Organization (WHO). Utilizing natural language processing techniques, a data quality score ranging from 0 to 5 was assigned to each data point, considering metadata aspects such as reporting data source, data type, methods of estimation, and completeness. These quality scores informed the weighing of raw data, and a spatiotemporal Gaussian process model was applied to generate comprehensive time series estimates from 1995 to 2019 for each country. Additionally, 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were calculated to convey the range of potential values, accounting for inherent uncertainties. More details about the methodology can be found in the paper titled “Global investments in pandemic preparedness and COVID-19: development assistance and domestic spending on health between 1990 and 2026.”\nThe dataset is structured in a tabular format, with each row representing a specific country or region and columns containing information on health spending metrics and related economic indicators. There are 79 indicators in total. The five primary variables—government health spending, out-of-pocket health spending, prepaid private health spending, and development assistance for health—all have mean values. Each of these variables is further stratified into subcategories, including per person, per total health spending, and per GDP. Additionally, the dataset provides values representing the lower and upper bounds for constant 2021 United States dollars, and lower and upper bounds for constant 2021 purchasing power parity power dollars, offering a comprehensive exploration of health spending dynamics across diverse metrics and dimensions.\nThis granularity enables a comprehensive examination of the financing landscape in the realm of global health. The inclusion of lower and upper bounds for each health spending metric, coupled with adjustments for inflation using country-specific exchange rates and the IMF World Economic Outlook database deflator series, reflects a commitment to methodological rigor and transparency.\nBy incorporating a range of values represented by lower and upper bounds, the dataset acknowledges the inherent uncertainty in economic and health expenditure forecasting. Economic conditions, currency exchange rates, and other external factors can introduce variability in health spending estimates. Therefore, providing a band of potential values serves as a safeguard against unforeseen fluctuations that may impact health spending trajectories.\nThe adjustment for inflation using country-specific exchange rates and IMF deflators is crucial for maintaining the temporal integrity of the dataset. It ensures that all spending estimates are expressed in a consistent and comparable unit (inflation-adjusted 2021 US dollars), allowing for meaningful analysis and interpretation across different time periods and geographic regions. This meticulous approach to data preparation enhances the dataset’s reliability and utility, catering to the diverse needs of researchers, policymakers, and analysts in the field of global health economics.\nThis dual-column structure, with lower and upper values, signifies a commitment to precision and transparency in data presentation. The lower and upper values serve as bookends, delineating a plausible range for each metric and acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in health expenditure estimates. This approach enhances the dataset’s reliability, providing users with nuanced insights into the potential variability of the reported values and promoting a more informed interpretation of global health spending trends.\nFrequency of Updates\nThe dataset on Global Health Spending from 1995 to 2019, provided by IHME, does not appear to be regularly updated, and its last recorded information release was on January 24, 2023.\nImporting the Data\nFrom the IHME Global Health Data Exchange website, anyone can download the datasets, which are encompassed in an 834.93 KB CSV file (2015-2019) and a 1.09 MB CSV file (2020-2050). These files can then be conveniently imported into R for further analysis."

    "text": "2.2 Research Plan\nWithin this section, we will undertake a detailed exploration of how this comprehensive dataset equips us to thoroughly respond to the research questions introduced earlier.\nTrends in Global Health Spending Over Time\nIn this segment, our objective is to visually represent the evolving trends in global health spending over time. To achieve this, we will employ a multiple-line chart, enabling a comprehensive comparison of total health spending, spending per capita, and spending as a percentage of GDP across different temporal spans. By leveraging this visualization technique, we aim to discern any notable trends or patterns in health spending over the specified timeframe. This approach not only facilitates an exploration of the transformation in total global health spending but also provides insights into the observed trends, allowing us to investigate the potential impact of major global events, such as pandemics, on health spending.\nGeographic Disparities\nIn our pursuit to unveil geographic disparities, we will direct our focus on different regions, which may be country-specific or continent-specific. This approach enables us to explore variations in health spending across diverse regions or continents.\nTo commence, our examination will involve comparing health expenditure trends over time for various continents. Moreover, considering that the dataset categorizes countries into low, middle, and high-income groups, we aim to analyze health expenditure trends over time within these distinct income brackets.\nAdding granularity to our exploration, we intend to provide an overview of total health spending in the dataset’s most recent year, 2019. Through a geographic map, we will visualize total health spending with a continuous scale, creating an animated cartogram for the year 2019. This cartogram will specifically highlight total health spending and break it down into three categories: government, out-of-pocket, and pre-paid private spending.\nAs a complementary visualization, we will construct a horizontal bar chart to compare total health spending for each country or region. This visualization is particularly effective in illustrating disparities. Additionally, a stacked bar chart will be employed to showcase the composition of health spending in each country, delineating categories such as government spending, out-of-pocket expenses, and prepaid private financing. This approach aims to provide insights into how countries allocate resources within their health systems, further contributing to our understanding of geographic health spending disparities.\nHealth Spending by Financing Source\nOur third research theme delves into the intricate landscape of health spending by financing source. The dataset meticulously categorizes health spending into three domestic financing sources: government, out-of-pocket, and prepaid private. Within this section, our aim is to unravel nuanced patterns within these categories, exploring how they have evolved over the years from 1995 to 2019. Our particular interest lies in identifying potential effects of global events embedded in the data.\nTo visually capture the evolving dynamics of health spending by financing source, we advocate for the creation of proportional stacked bar graphs spanning the years from 1995 to 2019. These graphs will serve as insightful tools, facilitating a comparative analysis of the proportions of different financing sources relative to each other across various temporal slices. Specifically, our plan includes generating three distinct graphs representing total spending, spending per person, and spending as a percentage of GDP over the specified time frame, all visualized as proportional stacked bar graphs. This approach provides an effective means to discern shifts and variations over the years, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the intricate dynamics shaping health spending patterns.\nMoreover, our focus on the year 2019, being the most recent year, aims to present a current snapshot of the financial health expenditure landscape. To vividly illustrate the different proportions of health spending in this pivotal year, we intend to employ a pie chart. This visualization will offer a clear and concise representation of the distribution of financing sources, providing a succinct overview of the financial health expenditure situation in 2019.\nGlobal Health Spending Patterns 2020 to 2050\nFor the last theme we will compare the past with future health spending patterns. We wil compare them based on the three themes discussed above, so over time patterns, geographic disparities, and health spending by financing source.\nTo compare them over time, we will create a line chart for the years 1995 to 2050, where the past and future predictions are distinguishable by color. We will do the same for the three different health spending categories (government, out-of-pocket, and prepaid private). Furthermore, we will create stacked bar charts for the years 1995 to 2050 to compare the proportions of financing sources and how they will change over time.\nFocusing on the second theme, the geographic disparities. We will create a world map for the years 1995, 2019 and 2050 which will allow us to visually compare the total health spending patterns geographically and how they change over time.\nTo compare both time and geographic are of the past and future, we want to create a heatmap to display health spending trends across both time and regions. Color intensity will represent spending levels, providing a visual summary of variations over the entire dataset."
