    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe allocation and trends in health spending wield profound implications for the well-being of nations. Timely and accurate information on health expenditure is crucial for preparing and responding to health emergencies, including pandemics. It enables countries and international organizations to allocate resources strategically, strengthen healthcare infrastructure, and enhance preparedness measures. This information is also vital for assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of health services, identifying areas for improvement, and achieving better health outcomes. Finally, estimates of future health spending can be beneficial for policymakers and planners and can identify financing gaps.\nThis project delves into the realm of visualizing and comprehending the dynamics of Global Health Spending—a subject of paramount importance often obscured in the complexity of its vast dataset. The decision to explore this topic is rooted in the imperative to unravel patterns, disparities, and trends shaping how countries invest in the health and well-being of their populations. To do so, we leverage a comprehensive dataset containing health expenditure data for 204 countries from 1995 to 2019, produced by the Global Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network. This dataset encompasses a myriad of components, from government contributions and out-of-pocket expenses to development assistance and prepaid private financing. This holistic perspective on health spending transcends individual borders, offering insights into the global landscape of healthcare economics.\nThe questions propelling this inquiry are as diverse as the facets of health spending itself. Seeking to bring clarity to this complexity, this research aims to address critical queries that traverse the temporal, geographical, financial source and future dimensions of health expenditure. Therefore, we will focus on the following three themes: Trends in Global Health Spending Over Time, Geographic Disparities, and Health Spending by Financing Source.\nTrends in Global Health Spending Over Time\nThe first trajectory of inquiry delves into the temporal evolution of global health spending, exploring changes from 1995 to 2019. Questions arise: Are there discernible trends or patterns in health spending over this span of time? How has total global health spending transformed, and what insights can be gleaned from the observed trends? Another avenue we explore is investigating the impact of major global events (e.g., pandemics) on health spending across different regions. Can patterns or anomalies be identified in health spending during significant events, providing valuable insights into global healthcare resilience?\nGeographic Disparities\nA second avenue of exploration navigates the disparities in health spending across diverse regions or continents. This prompts an examination of variations: Do certain regions consistently outpace others in health spending? Are there observable disparities that unveil regional predilections in healthcare investment? How do low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries compare in terms of health spending trends over time?\nHealth Spending by Financing Source\nMoving further, the research scrutinizes the sources fueling health spending. How much comes from government allocations, out-of-pocket expenses, and prepaid private sources? How have these proportions changed globally over time? We aim to paint a nuanced picture of the financial architecture sustaining healthcare systems.\nIn summary, this research endeavors to narrow the divide between raw data and nuanced comprehension, cultivating a holistic perspective on the determinants shaping investments in inclusive and enduring health systems on a global scale. Our intent is to pinpoint critical areas where the health economy may exhibit vulnerabilities in the face of potential forthcoming global challenges. Emphasizing the significance of meticulously tracking health expenditure, we illuminate anticipated challenges on the horizon."

    "section": "2.3 Missing value analysis",
    "text": "2.3 Missing value analysis\nAs a whole, the data seems to be very clean. Upon thorough scrutiny of the data set, it becomes apparent that a singular column, the column titled “iso3,” has missing data. This column had 100 missing values, while all the other columns had no missing information.\n\nThese missing values, however, are not indicative of a flaw or oversight but rather a deliberate design choice in alignment with the dataset’s prescribed structure.The “iso3” column serves as a repository for three-letter country codes, crucial for country-specific identification. Upon closer inspection, it is discernible that certain rows within this column intentionally lack values. The rows that have missing is03 values correspond to values High income, Low income, Lower-middle income, and Upper-middle income in “location_name” column. This intentional omission is justified by consulting the dataset’s documentation, where it is explicitly stated that these specific entries do not correspond to any particular country.\n\nInstead, these instances are intended to encapsulate broader, non-country-specific information or aggregates that do not require a specific country code. In essence, the intentional missing values in the “iso3” column serve as placeholders for entries that transcend the bounds of individual countries, reflecting a nuanced data structure designed to accommodate diverse information categories within the dataset.\nThat being said, after taking a closer look at the data, we noticed that there are “-” or O inserted as some values.\nThose columns that have missing values and how many there are are:\nwith - values: ppp_total_mean 86\nppp_total_lower 400\nppp_total_upper 75 ppp_total_ppp_mean 83\nppp_total_ppp_lower 386 ppp_total_ppp_upper 77\noop_total_lower 25 oop_total_ppp_lower 25\ndah_total_mean 399\ndah_total_ppp_mean 399\nwith “0” values: dah_total_mean 1000 dah_total_ppp_mean 1000 ghes_per_cap_mean 9\nghes_per_cap_lower 17\nghes_per_cap_upper 5\nppp_per_cap_mean 747 ppp_per_cap_lower 928\nppp_per_cap_upper 633\nppp_per_cap_ppp_mean 599 ppp_per_cap_ppp_lower 692 ppp_per_cap_ppp_upper 510 oop_per_cap_mean 25 oop_per_cap_lower 25\noop_per_cap_upper 12\noop_per_cap_ppp_mean 25 oop_per_cap_ppp_lower 25\noop_per_cap_ppp_upper 19\ndah_per_cap_mean 1857\ndah_per_cap_ppp_mean 1700\nppp_per_the_mean 497\nppp_per_the_lower 499 ppp_per_the_upper 460 oop_per_the_mean 25\noop_per_the_lower 25\noop_per_the_upper 25\ndah_per_the_mean 1654\ndah_per_the_lower 1660\ndah_per_the_upper 1648\nppp_per_gdp_mean 965 ppp_per_gdp_lower 1237\nppp_per_gdp_upper 800 oop_per_gdp_mean 25\noop_per_gdp_lower 25\noop_per_gdp_upper 25\ndah_per_gdp_mean 2555\ndah_per_gdp_lower 2591\ndah_per_gdp_upper 2537\nBelow are two bar graphs with this information illustrated.\n \nOur exploration into the dataset revealed a notable presence of missing values, primarily indicated by either a dash (“-”) or a zero (0). To systematically address this issue, we adopted a meticulous approach wherein we examined the consistency of missing values for each country across different years. Remarkably, we observed variations in the extent of missing data for certain countries, leading us to recognize the importance of treating missing values on a need-to-know basis.\nRecognizing the significance of preserving data integrity, we opted for a cautious strategy rather than employing imputation techniques. Given the structure of the dataset, with each country represented by 25 rows (corresponding to years), we carefully considered the potential implications of missing data. Instead of imputing values, we made a strategic decision to convert missing values, represented by dashes (“-”) or zeros, into zeros. This decision was grounded in the understanding that genuine health expenditure values for any country are unlikely to be zero and eliminates the risk of misinterpretation associated with imputed values. By adopting this approach, we aimed to ensure transparency and accuracy in our analyses while mitigating the impact of missing values on the overall exploration."

    "text": "The exploration of global health expenditure spanning the years 1995 to 2019, using the extensive dataset from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), has uncovered intricate financial trends. The visualizations showcased below illuminate key patterns, shifts, and disparities in health expenditure over the past two and a half decades. These visuals not only capture the scale of financial investments in health across regions and nations but also spotlight the evolving priorities and challenges within the global health expenditure ecosystem. Whether examining trajectories of total expenditure or dissecting spending by specific expenditure sources, our visualizations aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the economic dimensions of global health expenditure for the past two decades.\nThroughout our analysis, unless explicitly stated, we consistently employed the average value per capita as a key metric. Our exploration encompassed not only overall health spending for each country but also delved into three distinct financing sources: Global Health Expenditure (GHES), Out-of-Pocket Health Expenditures (OOP), and Prepaid Private Health Expenditures (PPP). To narrow our focus, we strategically examined three primary groupings of countries: those classified under continents, the overarching category of individual countries, and income-based grouped countries. This multifaceted approach allowed us to uncover and present insights at various scales, providing a comprehensive understanding of global health expenditure dynamics. Moreover, several graphics feature an interactive element, allowing users to hover over data points and access additional information pertinent to the displayed data.\nAnalyzing Trends between 1995 and 2019 on a Macro Level\nTo start off, we wanted to start with a macro-level analysis, so we delve into the evolving trends in global health expenditure from 1995 to 2019 based on the country groupings that were provided in the dataset and shown in the graph.\n\n\nCode\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(readr)\n\n# Read data from CSV\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"other_files/data.csv\")\n\n# Convert 'year' to a factor to ensure proper ordering on the x-axis\ndata$year &lt;- as.factor(data$year)\n\n# Specify the specific values of location_name you want to include in the plot\nselected_locations &lt;- c(\"Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia\", \n                        \"Latin America and Caribbean\", \n                        \"North Africa and Middle East\", \n                        \"South Asia\", \n                        \"Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Oceania\",\n                        \"Sub-Saharan Africa\")\n\n# Filter the dataframe based on the selected location names\nfiltered_df &lt;- data %&gt;% \n  filter(location_name %in% selected_locations) %&gt;%\n  select(year, location_name, ghes_per_cap_mean, ppp_per_cap_mean, oop_per_cap_mean) %&gt;%\n  gather(key = \"Expenditure\", value = \"value\", -year, -location_name)\n\n# Ensure that the 'value' column is numeric\nfiltered_df &lt;- filtered_df %&gt;% mutate(value = as.numeric(value))\n\n# Plot: Health Expenditure Over Time for specific columns with facets and scaled y-axis\nplot &lt;- ggplot(filtered_df, aes(x = year, y = value, \n                                group = interaction(Expenditure, location_name),\n                                color = Expenditure,\n                                text = paste(\"Location: \", location_name, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                                             \"Year: \", year, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                                             \"Expenditure: \", Expenditure, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                                             \"Value: \", value))) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  geom_point(size = 1) +\n  ggtitle(\"Domestic Financing Health Expenditure Over Time\") +\n  ylab(\"Health Expenditure Per Person\") +\n  facet_grid(location_name ~ ., scales = \"free_y\") +  # Facet based on location and variable\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 1, size = 8),\n        strip.background = element_blank(),  # Remove strip background\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        legend.title = element_blank())\n\nplotly_object &lt;- ggplotly(plot) %&gt;%\n  layout(legend = list(orientation = \"h\", x = 0.2, y = -0.2),\n         margin = list(b = 120, r = 280),\n         height = 500) # Increase bottom and right margins\n\n# Show the Plotly object\nplotly_object\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentral Europe, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia exhibit an overall increase in all financing sources. Notably, Government Health Spending and Out-of-Pocket Health Spending experienced significance increases, overtaking the trajectory of Prepaid Private Health Spending. This dynamic is indicative of a robust and multifaceted approach to healthcare financing within this region, where both public and individual financial commitments have significantly grown.\nIn Latin American and Caribbean countries, all three expenditure categories witness an upward trajectory. However, the trajectory of Out-of-Pocket spending introduces a layer of complexity. The period until 2009 witnessed an ascent, followed by a subsequent decline. This peculiarity warrants a deeper investigation into the underlying factors, potentially unveiling shifts in healthcare policies, societal expectations, or economic fluctuations that have sculpted this distinctive pattern.\nSimilarly, North African and Middle Eastern countries showcase an upward trend in overall health expenditure, with Out-of-Pocket spending experiencing fluctuations, including a dip in 2012 and 2013. This distinct pattern deviates from the general trajectory observed in other regions, prompting further exploration into geopolitical and economic events that may have influenced the healthcare spending landscape within this region.\nIn general, South Asian countries uniquely feature Out-of-Pocket as the primary financing source, and while witnessing an ascent from 1995 to 2015, there is a gradual decline post-2015. This deviation from the norm invites contemplation on the region’s evolving economic dynamics and healthcare policy paradigms.\nNext, the graph below explores each grouping of health expenditure and shows how the spending for each region has changed from 1995 to 2019. Across the spectrum of countries and regions, the overarching trend delineates the ascendancy of Government Health Spending, marking a possible steadfast commitment to bolster public health initiatives. The discernible increase in this financing source could be indicative of a global prioritization of citizens’ well-being. Prepaid Private Health Spending consistently emerges as the least significant contributor across all country groupings, emphasizing its comparatively muted role in the grand scheme of health expenditure.\n\n\nCode\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Read data from CSV\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"other_files/data.csv\")\n\n# Convert 'year' to a factor to ensure proper ordering on the x-axis\ndata$year &lt;- as.factor(data$year)\n\n# Specify the specific values of location_name you want to include in the plot\nselected_locations &lt;- c(\"Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia\", \n                        \"Latin America and Caribbean\", \n                        \"North Africa and Middle East\", \n                        \"South Asia\", \n                        \"Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Oceania\",\n                        \"Sub-Saharan Africa\")\n\n# Filter the dataframe based on the selected location names\nfiltered_df &lt;- data %&gt;% \n  filter(location_name %in% selected_locations) %&gt;%\n  select(year, location_name, ghes_per_cap_mean, ppp_per_cap_mean, oop_per_cap_mean) %&gt;%\n  gather(key = \"variable\", value = \"value\", -year, -location_name)\n\n# Ensure that the 'value' column is numeric\nfiltered_df &lt;- filtered_df %&gt;% mutate(value = as.numeric(value))\n\n# Plot: Health Expenditure Over Time for specific columns with facets\nggplot_object &lt;- ggplot(filtered_df, aes(x = year, y = value, \n                                         group = interaction(location_name, variable),\n                                         color = location_name,\n                                         text = paste(\"Location: \", location_name, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                                                      \"Year: \", year, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                                                      \"Variable: \", variable, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                                                      \"Value: \", value))) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  geom_point(size = 1) +\n  ggtitle(\"Domestic Financing Health Expenditure Over Time\") +\n  xlab(\"Year\") +\n  ylab(\"Health Expenditure per Person\") +\n  facet_grid(variable ~ ., scales = \"free\") +  # Facet based on variable\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 1), axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  labs(color = \"Location\")\n\n# Convert ggplot to Plotly\nplotly_object &lt;- ggplotly(ggplot_object)\n\n# Manually set legend position to bottom\nplotly_object &lt;- plotly_object %&gt;% \n  layout(legend = list(orientation = \"h\", x = 0, y = -0.1),\n         margin = list(b = 80, r = 150),  # Adjusted margin\n         height = 700)  # Increase height for better display\n\n# Show the Plotly object\nplotly_object\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSub-Saharan Africa and South Asia consistently register as the groups of countries with the lowest health expenditure across all financing expenditures. This discovery could prompt contemplation on the intricate socioeconomic factors underlying these regions’ healthcare ecosystems, bringing forth questions about resource allocation, accessibility, and disparities in healthcare infrastructure.\nLatin America and the Caribbean are a consistent front-runner, boasting the highest or one of the highest spending levels in each financing source. This observation prompts exploration into the driving forces propelling this sustained commitment, whether rooted in economic prosperity, robust healthcare policies, or societal expectations.\nThe most substantial surge in Government Health Spending and Out-of-Pocket financing was present in Southeast Asian, East Asian, and Oceania countries. This dynamic shift not only underscores a strategic reorientation of financial commitments but also prompts a closer examination of the region-specific factors catalyzing this pronounced ascent. Delving into these disparities opens avenues for a nuanced understanding of the diverse trajectories shaping healthcare financing on a global scale.\nRegional/Income Disparities\nNext, we want to explore the intricate patterns of global health expenditure per continent (manually assigned and can be found in DataCleanup.qmd file), offering a comprehensive exploration of the diverse economic landscapes shaping healthcare financing strategies from 1995 to 2019.\n\n\nCode\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\nselected_continents &lt;- c(\"Africa\", \"Asia\", \"Europe\", \"North America\", \"Oceania\", \"South America\") \n\n# Calculate the mean values for each variable within each continent and year\nmean_data &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  group_by(continent, year) %&gt;%\n  filter(continent %in% selected_continents) %&gt;%\n  summarize(ghes_total_mean = mean(ghes_per_cap_mean, na.rm = TRUE),\n            ppp_total_mean = mean(ppp_per_cap_mean, na.rm = TRUE),\n            oop_total_mean = mean(oop_per_cap_mean, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# Reshape the data for plotting\nfiltered_data &lt;- mean_data %&gt;%\n  gather(key = \"variable\", value = \"value\", -continent, -year)\n\n# Ensure that the 'value' column is numeric\nfiltered_data &lt;- filtered_data %&gt;% mutate(value = as.numeric(value))\n\n# Create a stacked bar chart\nggplot_object &lt;- ggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = year, y = value, fill = variable)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"stack\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Mean Health Spending by Continent and Year\") +\n  xlab(\"Year\") +\n  ylab(\"Mean Health Spending\") +\n  facet_wrap(~continent, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 1) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"Year\")  # Set x-axis title\n\nggplot_object\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph above casts a revealing spotlight on diverse patterns in health expenditure across continents. What constantly persists is that the government remains the primary financier accross the global, regardless of year.\nUpon closer examination, notable differences in spending levels among continents become evident. Europe, North America, and Oceania emerge as exhibiting the highest health expenditure, while Africa, in contrast, grapples with a health spending allocation nearly half of the global average. This divergence opens the floor to further exploration into the underlying factors behind such pronounced variations, invoking considerations of economic prowess, healthcare infrastructure, and socio-economic determinants unique to each continent.\nWith this broad lens on health expenditure, we then wanted to explore income class differentials. The subsequent graph encapsulates the average values across all years, facilitating in understanding the relationship between income class and health expenditure.\n\n\nCode\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Visualization 2019 health spending per low-middle-high income country\n# Filter only on continents\ndesired_locations &lt;- c(\n  \"Low income\",\n  \"Lower-middle income\",\n  \"Upper-middle income\",\n  \"High income\"\n)\n\n# Filter data based on location_name and select relevant columns\nfiltered_data &lt;- data %&gt;% \n  filter(location_name %in% desired_locations) %&gt;%\n  select(year, location_name, ghes_per_cap_mean, oop_per_cap_mean, ppp_per_cap_mean)\n\n# Define the order of facets\nfacet_order &lt;- c(\"Low income\", \"Lower-middle income\", \"Upper-middle income\", \"High income\")\n\n# Convert 'location_name' to factor with specified order\nfiltered_data$location_name &lt;- factor(filtered_data$location_name, levels = facet_order)\n\n# Reshape data for better plotting\nreshaped_data &lt;- tidyr::pivot_longer(filtered_data, cols = c(ghes_per_cap_mean, oop_per_cap_mean, ppp_per_cap_mean), names_to = \"Spending_Source\", values_to = \"Health_Expenditure\")\n\n# Visualization 2019 health spending per low-middle-high income country\np &lt;- ggplot(data = reshaped_data, mapping = aes(x = Spending_Source, y = Health_Expenditure/100, fill = Spending_Source)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ location_name, scales = \"free_y\", nrow = 1, drop = TRUE, dir = \"h\", strip.position = \"bottom\") +\n  labs(title = \"Health Spending by Financing Source in 2019\",\n       subtitle = \"Per Continent\",\n       x = \"Spending Source\", \n       y = \"Health Expenditure (in Hundreds)\", \n       fill = \"Spending Source\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n        legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        legend.direction = \"horizontal\")\n\n# Convert ggplot to plotly\np_plotly &lt;- ggplotly(p) %&gt;%\n  layout(legend = list(orientation = \"h\", x = 0, y = -0.1),\n         title = \"\",\n         margin = list(b = 120, r = 50),\n         height = 500) # Increase bottom and right margins\n\n# Print the plotly object\np_plotly\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe visual provides a compelling insight into the dynamics of health expenditure as countries ascend through income classes. Notably, it reveals a discernible trend where government health expenditure and private health expenditures exhibit a positive correlation with income class. As countries progress into higher income classes, there is an increase in both government health expenditure and per capita PPP. This phenomenon suggests that wealthier nations tend to allocate more financial resources to their public health systems, potentially reflecting a commitment to providing comprehensive healthcare services supported by increased fiscal capacity. Conversely, a noteworthy observation is the inverse relationship seen in out-of-pocket (OOP) health expenditure. The visual illustrates a consistent decrease in OOP expenditures as countries move up the income ladder. This decline in OOP expenditure is significant, as it indicates a reduced reliance on individual OOP contributions for healthcare expenses in wealthier nations. This shift may signify enhanced social protection, improved access to health insurance, and greater government responsibility for financing healthcare services, contributing to a more equitable and sustainable healthcare system.This nuanced understanding can inform global health policy discussions and strategies aimed at fostering more inclusive and robust healthcare systems worldwide.\nBased on the previous visualizations, we saw that South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa countries seem to spend significantly less per person on health spending, which is also what is observed in this graph, in terms of total health expenditure per person. It seems that there was also not a significant increase in spending over time for those two groups of countries. Based on this graph, it can also be observed that the two largest increase in total health spending is in Southeast Asian, East Asian, and Oceanian countries and Central European, Eastern European, and Central Asian countries.\nIn summary, the visualizations offer a comprehensive exploration of health expenditure dynamics from 1995 to 2019. The initial graph underscores a consistent upward trajectory in Government Health spending, outpacing other sources, with Prepaid Private Health Spending consistently ranking lowest. Region-specific analyses reveal distinct patterns, such as significant increases in Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia, while South Asian countries uniquely rely on Out of Pocket financing. The second graph highlights persistent variations, with Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia consistently exhibiting the lowest spending and Latin America and the Caribbean often showing the highest across all financing types. Notably, Southeast Asian, East Asian, and Oceanian countries experience substantial increases in Government Health Spending and Out of Pocket financing. Lastly, the third graph reaffirms lower total health expenditure per person in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting limited growth. Conversely, Southeast Asian, East Asian, and Oceanian countries, along with Central European, Eastern European, and Central Asian countries, witness significant increases, spotlighting regional disparities in global health expenditure trends.\nGlobal Health Expenditure in 2019\nBy zeroing in on the 2019 data of global health expenditure, we gather information that defines the healthcare landscape with the most recent data that is provided to us. This focused lens enables a nuanced analysis, unraveling the intricate trends, disparities, and transformative shifts within Government Health Spending, Out of Pocket Health Spending, and Prepaid Private Health Spending across diverse regions. The specificity of the 2019 snapshot serves as a means to capture the essence of global health expenditures priorities, allocation patterns, and overarching dynamics of global health expenditures in this day and age.\nThis exploration of the financial landscape in 2019 not only discerns immediate trends but also acts as a strategic compass for anticipating future trajectories. These next visualizations offer a snapshot of where global health expenditure is currently, fostering a deeper understanding of the intricate dance between financial resources and healthcare outcomes.\nTaking a look at a parallel coordinates plot for the year 2019 adds an extra layer of analysis.

    "section": "2.1 Technical Description",
    "text": "2.1 Technical Description\nData Format and Collection\nThe data collection process involved multiple sources, with a primary focus on the World Health Organization’s Global Health Expenditure Database (GHED), a reputable repository compiling global health expenditure information. Additionally, data for development assistance for health (DAH) were sourced from various outlets, including program reports, budget data, national estimates, and National Health Accounts (NHAs). Domestic health spending sources, encompassing government, out-of-pocket, and prepaid private health spending, primarily relied on data from the WHO’s GHED. For countries not covered by GHED, information was extracted from respective country ministries of health or finance websites.\nAssessment of GHED-extracted data reliability involved scrutinizing metadata provided by the World Health Organization (WHO). Utilizing natural language processing techniques, a data quality score ranging from 0 to 5 was assigned to each data point, considering metadata aspects such as reporting data source, data type, methods of estimation, and completeness. These quality scores informed the weighing of raw data, and a spatiotemporal Gaussian process model was applied to generate comprehensive time series estimates from 1995 to 2019 for each country. Additionally, 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were calculated to convey the range of potential values, accounting for inherent uncertainties. More details about the methodology can be found in the paper titled “Global investments in pandemic preparedness and COVID-19: development assistance and domestic spending on health between 1990 and 2026.”\nThe dataset is structured in a tabular format, with each row representing a specific country or region and columns containing information on health spending metrics and related economic indicators. There are 79 indicators in total. The five primary variables—government health spending, out-of-pocket health spending, prepaid private health spending, and development assistance for health—all have mean values. Each of these variables is further stratified into subcategories, including per person, per total health spending, and per GDP. Additionally, the dataset provides values representing the lower and upper bounds for constant 2021 United States dollars, and lower and upper bounds for constant 2021 purchasing power parity power dollars, offering a comprehensive exploration of health spending dynamics across diverse metrics and dimensions.\nThis granularity enables a comprehensive examination of the financing landscape in the realm of global health. The inclusion of lower and upper bounds for each health spending metric, coupled with adjustments for inflation using country-specific exchange rates and the IMF World Economic Outlook database deflator series, reflects a commitment to methodological rigor and transparency.\nBy incorporating a range of values represented by lower and upper bounds, the dataset acknowledges the inherent uncertainty in economic and health expenditure forecasting. Economic conditions, currency exchange rates, and other external factors can introduce variability in health spending estimates. Therefore, providing a band of potential values serves as a safeguard against unforeseen fluctuations that may impact health spending trajectories.\nThe adjustment for inflation using country-specific exchange rates and IMF deflators is crucial for maintaining the temporal integrity of the dataset. It ensures that all spending estimates are expressed in a consistent and comparable unit (inflation-adjusted 2021 US dollars), allowing for meaningful analysis and interpretation across different time periods and geographic regions. This meticulous approach to data preparation enhances the dataset’s reliability and utility, catering to the diverse needs of researchers, policymakers, and analysts in the field of global health economics.\nThis dual-column structure, with lower and upper values, signifies a commitment to precision and transparency in data presentation. The lower and upper values serve as bookends, delineating a plausible range for each metric and acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in health expenditure estimates. This approach enhances the dataset’s reliability, providing users with nuanced insights into the potential variability of the reported values and promoting a more informed interpretation of global health spending trends.\nFrequency of Updates\nThe dataset on Global Health Spending from 1995 to 2019, provided by IHME, does not appear to be regularly updated, and its last recorded information release was on January 24, 2023.\nImporting the Data\nFrom the IHME Global Health Data Exchange website, anyone can download the datasets, which are encompassed in an 834.93 KB CSV file (2015-2019) and a 1.09 MB CSV file (2020-2050). These files can then be conveniently imported into R for further analysis."

This approach enables us to explore variations in health spending across diverse regions or continents.\nTo commence, our examination will involve comparing health expenditure trends over time for various continents. Moreover, considering that the dataset categorizes countries into low, middle, and high-income groups, we aim to analyze health expenditure trends over time within these distinct income brackets.\nAdding granularity to our exploration, we intend to provide an overview of total health spending in the dataset’s most recent year, 2019. Through a geographic map, we will visualize total health spending with a continuous scale, creating an animated cartogram for the year 2019. This cartogram will specifically highlight total health spending and break it down into three categories: government, out-of-pocket, and pre-paid private spending.\nAs a complementary visualization, we will construct a horizontal bar chart to compare total health spending for each country or region. This visualization is particularly effective in illustrating disparities. Additionally, a stacked bar chart will be employed to showcase the composition of health spending in each country, delineating categories such as government spending, out-of-pocket expenses, and prepaid private financing. This approach aims to provide insights into how countries allocate resources within their health systems, further contributing to our understanding of geographic health spending disparities."

Also, in all grouping of countries provided in the data, Prepaid Private Health Spending is the lowest spending out of all the financing sources. In Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia, it seems that all financing sources increased. That being said, Government Health Spending and Out Of Pocket Health Spending increased significantly more than Prepaid Private Health Spending. In Latin American and Caribbean countries, it seemst that all three spending increased. That being said, while Out of Pocket spending increased until 2009, then it started decreasing, but overall through the years it has increased from 1995 to 2019. Similarly to Latin American and Caribbean countries, overall in North African and Middle East countries, the out of pocket spending was slowly increased but then there was a dip in spending in 2012 and 2013 and then started increasing again. Unlike every other grouping of countries, South Asian countries top financing source was Out of Pocket, and while increasing 1995 to 2015, started slowly slowly decreasing after 2015.\nNext, the graph below explores each grouping of health expenditure and shows how the spending for each region has changed from 1995 to 2019.\n\n\nCode\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Read data from CSV\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"Code/data.csv\")\n\n# Convert 'year' to a factor to ensure proper ordering on the x-axis\ndata$year &lt;- as.factor(data$year)\n\n# Specify the specific values of location_name you want to include in the plot\nselected_locations &lt;- c(\"Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia\", \n                        \"Latin America and Caribbean\", \n                        \"North Africa and Middle East\", \n                        \"South Asia\", \n                        \"Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Oceania\",\n                        \"Sub-Saharan Africa\")\n\n# Filter the dataframe based on the selected location names\nfiltered_df &lt;- data %&gt;% \n  filter(location_name %in% selected_locations) %&gt;%\n  select(year, location_name, ghes_per_cap_mean, ppp_per_cap_mean, oop_per_cap_mean) %&gt;%\n  gather(key = \"variable\", value = \"value\", -year, -location_name)\n\n# Ensure that the 'value' column is numeric\nfiltered_df &lt;- filtered_df %&gt;% mutate(value = as.numeric(value))\n\n# Plot: Health Expenditure Over Time for specific columns with facets\nggplot_object &lt;- ggplot(filtered_df, aes(x = year, y = value, \n                                         group = interaction(location_name, variable),\n                                         color = location_name,\n                                         text = paste(\"Location: \", location_name, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                                                      \"Year: \", year, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                                                      \"Variable: \", variable, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                                                      \"Value: \", value))) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  geom_point(size = 1) +\n  ggtitle(\"Domestic Financing Health Expenditure Over Time\") +\n  xlab(\"Year\") +\n  ylab(\"Health Expenditure per Person\") +\n  facet_grid(variable ~ ., scales = \"free_y\") +  # Facet based on variable\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 1),axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))+\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Paired\") \n\n# Convert ggplot to Plotly\nplotly_object &lt;- ggplotly(ggplot_object)\n\n# Manually set legend position to bottom\nplotly_object &lt;- plotly_object %&gt;% \n  layout(legend = list(orientation = \"h\", x = 0.5, y = -0.1), title = \"Given Country Grouping\")\n\n# Show the Plotly object\nprint(plotly_object)\n\n\nFrom this graph, the most important aspect that you can observe is that, for all financing types, the countries grouping that had the lowest spending were Sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia. In addition, it seems much of the time, Latin America and Caribbean had the highest or one of the highest spending in each type. Also, the greatest increase in Government Health Spending and Oout of Pocket financing was in Southeast Asian, East Asia, and Ocenia countries.\nNow that we have seen the breakdown of the different types of spending and how that has changed over time, the graph below shows how the total global health expenditure has changed from 1995 to 2019.\n\n\nCode\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n# Specify the specific values of location_name you want to include in the plot\nselected_locations &lt;- c(\"Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia\", \n                        \"Latin America and Caribbean\", \n                        \"North Africa and Middle East\", \n                        \"South Asia\", \n                        \"Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Oceania\",\n                        \"Sub-Saharan Africa\")\n\n# Assuming your data frame is named 'data'\n# Convert 'year' to a factor to ensure proper ordering on the x-axis\ndata$year &lt;- as.factor(data$year)\n\n# Filter the data for the selected locations\nfiltered_data &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  filter(location_name %in% selected_locations)\n\n# Create a Plotly plot\nplot_ly(filtered_data, x = ~year, y = ~the_per_cap_mean, color = ~location_name, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines+markers') %&gt;%\n  layout(\n    title = \"The Total Mean Health Expenditure Over Time Per Person\",\n    xaxis = list(title = \"Year\"),\n    yaxis = list(title = \"Health Expenditure Per Person\"),\n    legend = list(orientation = \"h\", x = 0.5, y = -0.2)\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the previous graphs, we saw that South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa countries seem to spend significantly less per person on health spending, which is also what is observed in this graph, in terms of total health expenditure per person. It seems that there was also not a sigificant increase in spending over time for those two groups of countries. Based on this graph, it can also be observed that the two largest increase in total health spending is in Southeast Asian, East Asian, and Oceanian countries and Central European, Eastern European, and Central Asian countries.\nIn summary, the visualizations offer a comprehensive exploration of health expenditure dynamics from 1995 to 2019. The initial graph underscores a consistent upward trajectory in Government Health spending, outpacing other sources, with Prepaid Private Health Spending consistently ranking lowest. Region-specific analyses reveal distinct patterns, such as significant increases in Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia, while South Asian countries uniquely rely on Out of Pocket financing. The second graph highlights persistent variations, with Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia consistently exhibiting the lowest spending and Latin America and the Caribbean often showing the highest across all financing types. Notably, Southeast Asian, East Asian, and Oceanian countries experience substantial increases in Government Health Spending and Out of Pocket financing. Lastly, the third graph reaffirms lower total health expenditure per person in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting limited growth. Conversely, Southeast Asian, East Asian, and Oceanian countries, along with Central European, Eastern European, and Central Asian countries, witness significant increases, spotlighting regional disparities in global health expenditure trends."

    "text": "4.3 Analyzing Differences in Global Health Expenditure Per Continent\nNext, we want to explore the intricate patterns of global health expenditure per continent (manually assigned), offering a comprehensive exploration of the diverse economic landscapes shaping healthcare financing strategies from 1995 to 2019.\n\n\nCode\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\nselected_continents &lt;- c(\"Africa\", \"Asia\", \"Europe\", \"North America\", \"Oceania\", \"South America\") \n\n# Calculate the mean values for each variable within each continent and year\nmean_data &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  group_by(continent, year) %&gt;%\n  filter(continent %in% selected_continents) %&gt;%\n  summarize(ghes_total_mean = mean(ghes_per_cap_mean, na.rm = TRUE),\n            ppp_total_mean = mean(ppp_per_cap_mean, na.rm = TRUE),\n            oop_total_mean = mean(oop_per_cap_mean, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# Reshape the data for plotting\nfiltered_data &lt;- mean_data %&gt;%\n  gather(key = \"variable\", value = \"value\", -continent, -year)\n\n# Ensure that the 'value' column is numeric\nfiltered_data &lt;- filtered_data %&gt;% mutate(value = as.numeric(value))\n\n# Create a stacked bar chart\nggplot_object &lt;- ggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = year, y = value, fill = variable)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"stack\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Mean Health Spending by Continent and Year\") +\n  xlab(\"Year\") +\n  ylab(\"Mean Health Spending\") +\n  facet_wrap(~continent, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 2) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))+\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Convert ggplot to Plotly\nplotly_object &lt;- ggplotly(ggplot_object) %&gt;%\n  layout(legend = list(orientation = \"h\", x = 0.5, y = -0.1))\n         #xaxis = list(tickangle = 135),)\n\n# Show the Plotly object\nplotly_object\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then analyzed all the country data and grouped them within continent. There are many takeaways from this graph. It seems for each continent, no matter what year, the majority of the health spending is coming from the Government. Also based on these graphs, that you can see the spending amount is drastically different. The continents with the highest spending includes Europe, North America and Oceania while Africa’s health spending is almost half of that.\nNext, we are introducing a parallel coordinates plot illustrating the three distinct types of global expenditure — Government Health Spending, Out of Pocket Health Spending, and Prepaid Private Health Spending — across various locations and years, offering a comprehensive visualization of their dynamic relationships and trends.\n\n\nCode\n# Assuming your data frame is named 'data'\n# Filter data for the year 2019 and remove rows with missing values\nfiltered_data &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  filter(year == 2019, !is.na(ghes_total_mean), !is.na(ppp_total_mean), !is.na(oop_total_mean), continent != \"Unknown\")\n\n# Reshape the data for parallel coordinate plot\nmelted_data &lt;- filtered_data %&gt;%\n  select(location_name, ghes_per_cap_mean, ppp_per_cap_mean, oop_per_cap_mean, the_per_cap_mean, continent)\n\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(GGally)\n\n# Create a parallel coordinates plot\nplot &lt;- GGally::ggparcoord(\n  melted_data,\n  columns = 2:5,\n  groupColumn = \"continent\",\n  scale = \"globalminmax\",\n  showPoints = FALSE,\n  alphaLines = 0.5\n)\n# Customize the plot further if needed (e.g., add color)\nplot + scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set3\") +\n  labs(title = \"Parallel Coordinates Plot\",\n       x = \"Health Spending Components\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n       #y = \"Countries\")\n\n\nBased on this parallel coordinates plot, there are some observations you can make. It seems that in general, the value of Government Helath spending is varied. That is not the case for Private Health Spending and Out Of Pocket Health spending; despite some outliers, it seems that the money spent does not vary that much for those categories. Lastly, as we have seen in previous visualizations, the dispersion for total health spending is wide.\nNow that we have gotten a wider look into health expenditure, we want to focus on the expenditure in relation to GDP. Focusing on health expenditure as a percentage of GDP serves as a key metric in health economics, offering a standardized measure for comparing healthcare priorities, resource allocation, and system efficiency across countries. This approach facilitates meaningful international and temporal comparisons, aiding policymakers in assessing the relative importance of health within the broader economic landscape and informing decisions on sustainable healthcare development."

Also, in all grouping of countries provided in the data, Prepaid Private Health Spending is the lowest spending out of all the financing sources. In Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia, it seems that all financing sources increased. That being said, Government Health Spending and Out Of Pocket Health Spending increased significantly more than Prepaid Private Health Spending. In Latin American and Caribbean countries, it seemst that all three spending increased. That being said, while Out of Pocket spending increased until 2009, then it started decreasing, but overall through the years it has increased from 1995 to 2019. Similarly to Latin American and Caribbean countries, overall in North African and Middle East countries, the out of pocket spending was slowly increased but then there was a dip in spending in 2012 and 2013 and then started increasing again. Unlike every other grouping of countries, South Asian countries top financing source was Out of Pocket, and while increasing 1995 to 2015, started slowly slowly decreasing after 2015.\nNext, the graph below explores each grouping of health expenditure and shows how the spending for each region has changed from 1995 to 2019.\n\n\nCode\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Read data from CSV\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"Code/data.csv\")\n\n# Convert 'year' to a factor to ensure proper ordering on the x-axis\ndata$year &lt;- as.factor(data$year)\n\n# Specify the specific values of location_name you want to include in the plot\nselected_locations &lt;- c(\"Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia\", \n                        \"Latin America and Caribbean\", \n                        \"North Africa and Middle East\", \n                        \"South Asia\", \n                        \"Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Oceania\",\n                        \"Sub-Saharan Africa\")\n\n# Filter the dataframe based on the selected location names\nfiltered_df &lt;- data %&gt;% \n  filter(location_name %in% selected_locations) %&gt;%\n  select(year, location_name, ghes_per_cap_mean, ppp_per_cap_mean, oop_per_cap_mean) %&gt;%\n  gather(key = \"variable\", value = \"value\", -year, -location_name)\n\n# Ensure that the 'value' column is numeric\nfiltered_df &lt;- filtered_df %&gt;% mutate(value = as.numeric(value))\n\n# Plot: Health Expenditure Over Time for specific columns with facets\nggplot_object &lt;- ggplot(filtered_df, aes(x = year, y = value, \n                                         group = interaction(location_name, variable),\n                                         color = location_name,\n                                         text = paste(\"Location: \", location_name, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                                                      \"Year: \", year, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                                                      \"Variable: \", variable, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                                                      \"Value: \", value))) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  geom_point(size = 1) +\n  ggtitle(\"Domestic Financing Health Expenditure Over Time\") +\n  xlab(\"Year\") +\n  ylab(\"Health Expenditure per Person\") +\n  facet_grid(variable ~ ., scales = \"free\") +  # Facet based on variable\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 1), axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  labs(color = \"Location\")\n\n# Convert ggplot to Plotly\nplotly_object &lt;- ggplotly(ggplot_object)\n\n# Manually set legend position to bottom\nplotly_object &lt;- plotly_object %&gt;% \n  layout(legend = list(orientation = \"h\", x = 0, y = -0.1),\n         margin = list(b = 80, r = 150),  # Adjusted margin\n         height = 700)  # Increase height for better display\n\n# Show the Plotly object\nplotly_object\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this graph, the most important aspect that you can observe is that, for all financing types, the countries grouping that had the lowest spending were Sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia. In addition, it seems much of the time, Latin America and Caribbean had the highest or one of the highest spending in each type. Also, the greatest increase in Government Health Spending and Oout of Pocket financing was in Southeast Asian, East Asia, and Ocenia countries.\nNow that we have seen the breakdown of the different types of spending and how that has changed over time, the graph below shows how the total global health expenditure has changed from 1995 to 2019.\nBased on the previous graphs, we saw that South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa countries seem to spend significantly less per person on health spending, which is also what is observed in this graph, in terms of total health expenditure per person. It seems that there was also not a sigificant increase in spending over time for those two groups of countries. Based on this graph, it can also be observed that the two largest increase in total health spending is in Southeast Asian, East Asian, and Oceanian countries and Central European, Eastern European, and Central Asian countries.\nIn summary, the visualizations offer a comprehensive exploration of health expenditure dynamics from 1995 to 2019. The initial graph underscores a consistent upward trajectory in Government Health spending, outpacing other sources, with Prepaid Private Health Spending consistently ranking lowest. Region-specific analyses reveal distinct patterns, such as significant increases in Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia, while South Asian countries uniquely rely on Out of Pocket financing. The second graph highlights persistent variations, with Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia consistently exhibiting the lowest spending and Latin America and the Caribbean often showing the highest across all financing types. Notably, Southeast Asian, East Asian, and Oceanian countries experience substantial increases in Government Health Spending and Out of Pocket financing. Lastly, the third graph reaffirms lower total health expenditure per person in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting limited growth. Conversely, Southeast Asian, East Asian, and Oceanian countries, along with Central European, Eastern European, and Central Asian countries, witness significant increases, spotlighting regional disparities in global health expenditure trends.\nNext, we want to explore the intricate patterns of global health expenditure per continent (manually assigned), offering a comprehensive exploration of the diverse economic landscapes shaping healthcare financing strategies from 1995 to 2019.\n\n\nCode\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\nselected_continents &lt;- c(\"Africa\", \"Asia\", \"Europe\", \"North America\", \"Oceania\", \"South America\") \n\n# Calculate the mean values for each variable within each continent and year\nmean_data &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  group_by(continent, year) %&gt;%\n  filter(continent %in% selected_continents) %&gt;%\n  summarize(ghes_total_mean = mean(ghes_per_cap_mean, na.rm = TRUE),\n            ppp_total_mean = mean(ppp_per_cap_mean, na.rm = TRUE),\n            oop_total_mean = mean(oop_per_cap_mean, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# Reshape the data for plotting\nfiltered_data &lt;- mean_data %&gt;%\n  gather(key = \"variable\", value = \"value\", -continent, -year)\n\n# Ensure that the 'value' column is numeric\nfiltered_data &lt;- filtered_data %&gt;% mutate(value = as.numeric(value))\n\n# Create a stacked bar chart\nggplot_object &lt;- ggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = year, y = value, fill = variable)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"stack\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Mean Health Spending by Continent and Year\") +\n  xlab(\"Year\") +\n  ylab(\"Mean Health Spending\") +\n  facet_wrap(~continent, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 1) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"Selected Year\")  # Set x-axis title\n\nggplot_object\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then analyzed all the country data and grouped them within continent. There are many takeaways from this graph. It seems for each continent, no matter what year, the majority of the health spending is coming from the Government. Also based on these graphs, that you can see the spending amount is drastically different. The continents with the highest spending includes Europe, North America and Oceania while Africa’s health spending is almost half of that.\nNow that we have gotten a wider look into health expenditure, we want to focus on income class to see if there is a difference in health expenditure. The graph below shows the average value over all years.\n\n\nCode\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Visualization 2019 health spending per low-middle-high income country\n# Filter only on continents\ndesired_locations &lt;- c(\n  \"Low income\",\n  \"Lower-middle income\",\n  \"Upper-middle income\",\n  \"High income\"\n)\n\n# Filter data based on location_name and select relevant columns\nfiltered_data &lt;- data %&gt;% \n  filter(location_name %in% desired_locations) %&gt;%\n  select(year, location_name, ghes_per_cap_mean, oop_per_cap_mean, ppp_per_cap_mean)\n\n# Define the order of facets\nfacet_order &lt;- c(\"Low income\", \"Lower-middle income\", \"Upper-middle income\", \"High income\")\n\n# Convert 'location_name' to factor with specified order\nfiltered_data$location_name &lt;- factor(filtered_data$location_name, levels = facet_order)\n\n# Reshape data for better plotting\nreshaped_data &lt;- tidyr::pivot_longer(filtered_data, cols = c(ghes_per_cap_mean, oop_per_cap_mean, ppp_per_cap_mean), names_to = \"Spending_Source\", values_to = \"Health_Expenditure\")\n\n# Visualization 2019 health spending per low-middle-high income country\np &lt;- ggplot(data = reshaped_data, mapping = aes(x = Spending_Source, y = Health_Expenditure/100, fill = Spending_Source)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ location_name, scales = \"free_y\", nrow = 1, drop = TRUE, dir = \"h\", strip.position = \"bottom\") +\n  labs(title = \"Health Spending by Financing Source in 2019\",\n       subtitle = \"Per Continent\",\n       x = \"Spending Source\", \n       y = \"Health Expenditure (in Hundreds)\", \n       fill = \"Spending Source\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n        legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        legend.direction = \"horizontal\")\n\n# Convert ggplot to plotly\np_plotly &lt;- ggplotly(p) %&gt;%\n  layout(legend = list(orientation = \"h\", x = 0, y = -0.1),\n         title = \"\",\n         margin = list(b = 120, r = 50),\n         height = 500) # Increase bottom and right margins\n\n# Print the plotly object\np_plotly\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe visual provides a compelling insight into the dynamics of health expenditure as countries ascend through income classes. Notably, it reveals a discernible trend where government health expenditure and per capita purchasing power parity (PPP) exhibit a positive correlation with income class. As countries progress into higher income classes, there is a demonstrative increase in both government health expenditure and per capita PPP. This phenomenon suggests that wealthier nations tend to allocate more financial resources to their public health systems, potentially reflecting a commitment to providing comprehensive healthcare services supported by increased fiscal capacity.\nConversely, a noteworthy observation is the inverse relationship seen in out-of-pocket (OOP) health spending. The visual illustrates a consistent decrease in OOP expenditures as countries move up the income ladder. This decline in OOP spending is significant, as it indicates a reduced reliance on individual out-of-pocket contributions for healthcare expenses in wealthier nations. This shift may signify enhanced social protection, improved access to health insurance, and greater government responsibility for financing healthcare services, contributing to a more equitable and sustainable healthcare system.\nIn summary, the visual underscores the intricate interplay between income levels and health expenditure components, highlighting the tendency for countries with higher income classes to allocate greater resources through government spending and reduce the burden on individuals through a decline in out-of-pocket expenses. This nuanced understanding can inform global health policy discussions and strategies aimed at fostering more inclusive and robust healthcare systems worldwide."

    "text": "3.1 Analyzing Trends on a Macro Level\nThe comprehensive analysis of the provided graph spanning the period from 1995 to 2019 reveals several intriguing trends in global health expenditure. Notably, the data suggests a general uptrend in Government Health Spending across diverse regions, outpacing other financing sources during this timeframe. In contrast, Prepaid Private Health Spending consistently emerges as the lowest among the various financing sources across all country groupings in the dataset.\nDelving into specific regional dynamics, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia exhibit an overall increase in all financing sources. However, the surge in Government Health Spending and Out-of-Pocket Health Spending notably surpasses the growth observed in Prepaid Private Health Spending. In Latin American and Caribbean countries, all three expenditure categories witness an upward trajectory. Although Out-of-Pocket spending experiences a brief decline in 2009, the overall trend indicates a consistent increase from 1995 to 2019.\nSimilarly, North African and Middle Eastern countries showcase an upward trend in overall health expenditure, with Out-of-Pocket spending experiencing fluctuations, including a dip in 2012 and 2013. This distinct pattern deviates from the general trajectory observed in other regions. Intriguingly, South Asian countries uniquely feature Out-of-Pocket as the primary financing source, and while witnessing an ascent from 1995 to 2015, there is a gradual decline post-2015.\nThis next graph serves as a pivotal lens through which we delve into the intricate dynamics of health expenditure within distinct regional groupings. The temporal canvas spans from 1995 to 2019, enabling a meticulous examination of how spending patterns have metamorphosed over this extensive period.\nThe temporal evolution encapsulated in this graph encapsulates the ebb and flow of financial allocations across diverse health expenditure categories. Each line on the graph intricately weaves the narrative of a region’s financial commitment to healthcare. From Government Health Spending, which often mirrors the public sector’s commitment to citizens’ well-being, to the dynamics of Prepaid Private Health Spending and the often-varied trajectories of Out-of-Pocket Health Spending.\nAs we scrutinize this temporal journey, the fluctuations, peaks, and troughs become narratives of societal and economic shifts, governmental policies, and the intricate dance between public and private spheres in the realm of healthcare funding.\n\n\nCode\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(readr)\n\n# Read data from CSV\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"Code/data.csv\")\n\n# Convert 'year' to a factor to ensure proper ordering on the x-axis\ndata$year &lt;- as.factor(data$year)\n\n# Specify the specific values of location_name you want to include in the plot\nselected_locations &lt;- c(\"Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia\", \n                        \"Latin America and Caribbean\", \n                        \"North Africa and Middle East\", \n                        \"South Asia\", \n                        \"Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Oceania\",\n                        \"Sub-Saharan Africa\")\n\n# Filter the dataframe based on the selected location names\nfiltered_df &lt;- data %&gt;% \n  filter(location_name %in% selected_locations) %&gt;%\n  select(year, location_name, ghes_per_cap_mean, ppp_per_cap_mean, oop_per_cap_mean) %&gt;%\n  gather(key = \"Expenditure\", value = \"value\", -year, -location_name)\n\n# Ensure that the 'value' column is numeric\nfiltered_df &lt;- filtered_df %&gt;% mutate(value = as.numeric(value))\n\n# Plot: Health Expenditure Over Time for specific columns with facets and scaled y-axis\nplot &lt;- ggplot(filtered_df, aes(x = year, y = value, \n                                group = interaction(Expenditure, location_name),\n                                color = Expenditure,\n                                text = paste(\"Location: \", location_name, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                                             \"Year: \", year, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                                             \"Expenditure: \", Expenditure, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                                             \"Value: \", value))) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  geom_point(size = 1) +\n  ggtitle(\"Domestic Financing Health Expenditure Over Time\") +\n  ylab(\"Health Spending Per Person\") +\n  facet_grid(location_name ~ ., scales = \"free_y\") +  # Facet based on location and variable\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 1, size = 8),\n        strip.background = element_blank(),  # Remove strip background\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        legend.position = \"bottom\")  # Move legend to the bottom)   # Add legend title\n\nplotly_object &lt;- ggplotly(plot) %&gt;%\n  layout(legend = list(orientation = \"h\", x = 0.2, y = -0.2),\n         margin = list(b = 120, r = 280),\n         height = 500) # Increase bottom and right margins\n\n# Show the Plotly object\nplotly_object\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross the spectrum of countries and regions, the overarching trend delineates the ascendancy of Government Health Spending, marking a steadfast commitment to bolster public health initiatives. The discernible increase in this financing source underscores a collective dedication to fortifying healthcare infrastructures and services, indicative of a global prioritization of citizens’ well-being. Prepaid Private Health Spending consistently emerges as the least significant contributor across all country groupings, emphasizing its comparatively muted role in the grand tapestry of health expenditure. This nuanced revelation prompts contemplation on the interplay between public and private healthcare sectors, sparking inquiries into the efficacy and inclusivity of diverse healthcare financing models.\nCentral Europe, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia, as exemplified by this visual odyssey, witnessed an overall surge in all financing sources. Notably, Government Health Spending and Out-of-Pocket Health Spending exhibited remarkable increments, eclipsing the trajectory of Prepaid Private Health Spending. This dynamic is indicative of a robust and multifaceted approach to healthcare financing within this region, where both public and individual financial commitments have significantly burgeoned.\nLatin American and Caribbean countries mirror a collective increase across the three spending categories. However, the nuanced trajectory of Out-of-Pocket spending introduces a layer of complexity. The period until 2009 witnessed an ascent, followed by a subsequent decline. This peculiarity warrants a deeper investigation into the underlying factors, potentially unveiling shifts in healthcare policies, societal expectations, or economic fluctuations that have sculpted this distinctive pattern.\nContrasting patterns materialize in North African and Middle East countries, where Out-of-Pocket spending exhibited a gradual increase, punctuated by a dip in 2012 and 2013, only to resume an upward trajectory. This anomaly beckons exploration into geopolitical and economic events that may have influenced the healthcare spending landscape within this region.\nSouth Asian countries deviate from the norm, as Out-of-Pocket emerges as the predominant financing source. While a steady increase from 1995 to 2015 underscores the resilience of this model, a subsequent deceleration after 2015 invites contemplation on the region’s evolving economic dynamics and healthcare policy paradigms.\nNext, the graph below explores each grouping of health expenditure and shows how the spending for each region has changed from 1995 to 2019.\n\n\nCode\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Read data from CSV\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"Code/data.csv\")\n\n# Convert 'year' to a factor to ensure proper ordering on the x-axis\ndata$year &lt;- as.factor(data$year)\n\n# Specify the specific values of location_name you want to include in the plot\nselected_locations &lt;- c(\"Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia\", \n                        \"Latin America and Caribbean\", \n                        \"North Africa and Middle East\", \n                        \"South Asia\", \n                        \"Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Oceania\",\n                        \"Sub-Saharan Africa\")\n\n# Filter the dataframe based on the selected location names\nfiltered_df &lt;- data %&gt;% \n  filter(location_name %in% selected_locations) %&gt;%\n  select(year, location_name, ghes_per_cap_mean, ppp_per_cap_mean, oop_per_cap_mean) %&gt;%\n  gather(key = \"variable\", value = \"value\", -year, -location_name)\n\n# Ensure that the 'value' column is numeric\nfiltered_df &lt;- filtered_df %&gt;% mutate(value = as.numeric(value))\n\n# Plot: Health Expenditure Over Time for specific columns with facets\nggplot_object &lt;- ggplot(filtered_df, aes(x = year, y = value, \n                                         group = interaction(location_name, variable),\n                                         color = location_name,\n                                         text = paste(\"Location: \", location_name, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                                                      \"Year: \", year, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                                                      \"Variable: \", variable, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                                                      \"Value: \", value))) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  geom_point(size = 1) +\n  ggtitle(\"Domestic Financing Health Expenditure Over Time\") +\n  xlab(\"Year\") +\n  ylab(\"Health Expenditure per Person\") +\n  facet_grid(variable ~ ., scales = \"free\") +  # Facet based on variable\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 1), axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  labs(color = \"Location\")\n\n# Convert ggplot to Plotly\nplotly_object &lt;- ggplotly(ggplot_object)\n\n# Manually set legend position to bottom\nplotly_object &lt;- plotly_object %&gt;% \n  layout(legend = list(orientation = \"h\", x = 0, y = -0.1),\n         margin = list(b = 80, r = 150),  # Adjusted margin\n         height = 700)  # Increase height for better display\n\n# Show the Plotly object\nplotly_object\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSub-Saharan Africa and South Asia consistently register as the cohorts with the lowest health expenditure across all financing types. This stark dichotomy prompts contemplation on the intricate socio-economic factors underlying these regions’ healthcare ecosystems, bringing forth questions about resource allocation, accessibility, and disparities in healthcare infrastructure.\nFurther unraveling the tapestry of global health expenditure, Latin America and the Caribbean unfurl as a consistent front-runner, boasting the highest or one of the highest spending levels in each financing type. This nuanced observation prompts exploration into the driving forces propelling this sustained commitment, whether rooted in economic prosperity, robust healthcare policies, or societal expectations.\nIntriguingly, the epicenter of the most substantial surge in Government Health Spending and Out-of-Pocket financing unveils itself in Southeast Asian, East Asian, and Oceania countries. This dynamic shift not only underscores a strategic reorientation of financial commitments but also beckons a closer examination of the region-specific factors catalyzing this pronounced ascent. Delving into these disparities opens avenues for a nuanced understanding of the diverse trajectories shaping healthcare financing on a global scale.\nNext, we want to explore the intricate patterns of global health expenditure per continent (manually assigned), offering a comprehensive exploration of the diverse economic landscapes shaping healthcare financing strategies from 1995 to 2019.\n\n\nCode\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\nselected_continents &lt;- c(\"Africa\", \"Asia\", \"Europe\", \"North America\", \"Oceania\", \"South America\") \n\n# Calculate the mean values for each variable within each continent and year\nmean_data &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  group_by(continent, year) %&gt;%\n  filter(continent %in% selected_continents) %&gt;%\n  summarize(ghes_total_mean = mean(ghes_per_cap_mean, na.rm = TRUE),\n            ppp_total_mean = mean(ppp_per_cap_mean, na.rm = TRUE),\n            oop_total_mean = mean(oop_per_cap_mean, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# Reshape the data for plotting\nfiltered_data &lt;- mean_data %&gt;%\n  gather(key = \"variable\", value = \"value\", -continent, -year)\n\n# Ensure that the 'value' column is numeric\nfiltered_data &lt;- filtered_data %&gt;% mutate(value = as.numeric(value))\n\n# Create a stacked bar chart\nggplot_object &lt;- ggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = year, y = value, fill = variable)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"stack\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Mean Health Spending by Continent and Year\") +\n  xlab(\"Year\") +\n  ylab(\"Mean Health Spending\") +\n  facet_wrap(~continent, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 1) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"Selected Year\")  # Set x-axis title\n\nggplot_object\n\n\n\n\n\nDiving into a comprehensive examination, we meticulously scrutinized individual country data, orchestrating them into coherent continental clusters. The resultant graph casts a revealing spotlight on diverse patterns in health expenditure across continents. A predominant narrative emerges, depicting the government as the primary financier across the globe, regardless of the temporal dimension.\nA closer inspection lays bare significant contrasts in spending levels among continents. Europe, North America, and Oceania emerge as financial powerhouses, exhibiting the highest health expenditure, while Africa, in contrast, grapples with a health spending allocation nearly half of the global average. This divergence beckons a probing exploration into the underlying factors propelling such pronounced variations, invoking considerations of economic prowess, healthcare infrastructure, and socio-economic determinants unique to each continent.\nWith this broad lens on health expenditure, we embark on a nuanced exploration of income class differentials. The subsequent graph artfully encapsulates the average values across all years, acting as a gateway to unraveling the intricate relationship between income class and health expenditure. This focused endeavor promises a granular understanding of how economic strata influence healthcare financing dynamics, unraveling layers of insights pivotal for informed policy decisions and global health management.\n\n\nCode\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Visualization 2019 health spending per low-middle-high income country\n# Filter only on continents\ndesired_locations &lt;- c(\n  \"Low income\",\n  \"Lower-middle income\",\n  \"Upper-middle income\",\n  \"High income\"\n)\n\n# Filter data based on location_name and select relevant columns\nfiltered_data &lt;- data %&gt;% \n  filter(location_name %in% desired_locations) %&gt;%\n  select(year, location_name, ghes_per_cap_mean, oop_per_cap_mean, ppp_per_cap_mean)\n\n# Define the order of facets\nfacet_order &lt;- c(\"Low income\", \"Lower-middle income\", \"Upper-middle income\", \"High income\")\n\n# Convert 'location_name' to factor with specified order\nfiltered_data$location_name &lt;- factor(filtered_data$location_name, levels = facet_order)\n\n# Reshape data for better plotting\nreshaped_data &lt;- tidyr::pivot_longer(filtered_data, cols = c(ghes_per_cap_mean, oop_per_cap_mean, ppp_per_cap_mean), names_to = \"Spending_Source\", values_to = \"Health_Expenditure\")\n\n# Visualization 2019 health spending per low-middle-high income country\np &lt;- ggplot(data = reshaped_data, mapping = aes(x = Spending_Source, y = Health_Expenditure/100, fill = Spending_Source)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ location_name, scales = \"free_y\", nrow = 1, drop = TRUE, dir = \"h\", strip.position = \"bottom\") +\n  labs(title = \"Health Spending by Financing Source in 2019\",\n       subtitle = \"Per Continent\",\n       x = \"Spending Source\", \n       y = \"Health Expenditure (in Hundreds)\", \n       fill = \"Spending Source\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n        legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        legend.direction = \"horizontal\")\n\n# Convert ggplot to plotly\np_plotly &lt;- ggplotly(p) %&gt;%\n  layout(legend = list(orientation = \"h\", x = 0, y = -0.1),\n         title = \"\",\n         margin = list(b = 120, r = 50),\n         height = 500) # Increase bottom and right margins\n\n# Print the plotly object\np_plotly\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe visual provides a compelling insight into the dynamics of health expenditure as countries ascend through income classes. Notably, it reveals a discernible trend where government health expenditure and per capita purchasing power parity (PPP) exhibit a positive correlation with income class. As countries progress into higher income classes, there is a demonstrative increase in both government health expenditure and per capita PPP. This phenomenon suggests that wealthier nations tend to allocate more financial resources to their public health systems, potentially reflecting a commitment to providing comprehensive healthcare services supported by increased fiscal capacity.\nConversely, a noteworthy observation is the inverse relationship seen in out-of-pocket (OOP) health spending. The visual illustrates a consistent decrease in OOP expenditures as countries move up the income ladder. This decline in OOP spending is significant, as it indicates a reduced reliance on individual out-of-pocket contributions for healthcare expenses in wealthier nations. This shift may signify enhanced social protection, improved access to health insurance, and greater government responsibility for financing healthcare services, contributing to a more equitable and sustainable healthcare system.\nIn summary, the visual underscores the intricate interplay between income levels and health expenditure components, highlighting the tendency for countries with higher income classes to allocate greater resources through government spending and reduce the burden on individuals through a decline in out-of-pocket expenses. This nuanced understanding can inform global health policy discussions and strategies aimed at fostering more inclusive and robust healthcare systems worldwide.\nBased on the previous graphs, we saw that South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa countries seem to spend significantly less per person on health spending, which is also what is observed in this graph, in terms of total health expenditure per person. It seems that there was also not a sigificant increase in spending over time for those two groups of countries. Based on this graph, it can also be observed that the two largest increase in total health spending is in Southeast Asian, East Asian, and Oceanian countries and Central European, Eastern European, and Central Asian countries.\nIn summary, the visualizations offer a comprehensive exploration of health expenditure dynamics from 1995 to 2019. The initial graph underscores a consistent upward trajectory in Government Health spending, outpacing other sources, with Prepaid Private Health Spending consistently ranking lowest. Region-specific analyses reveal distinct patterns, such as significant increases in Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia, while South Asian countries uniquely rely on Out of Pocket financing. The second graph highlights persistent variations, with Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia consistently exhibiting the lowest spending and Latin America and the Caribbean often showing the highest across all financing types. Notably, Southeast Asian, East Asian, and Oceanian countries experience substantial increases in Government Health Spending and Out of Pocket financing. Lastly, the third graph reaffirms lower total health expenditure per person in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting limited growth. Conversely, Southeast Asian, East Asian, and Oceanian countries, along with Central European, Eastern European, and Central Asian countries, witness significant increases, spotlighting regional disparities in global health expenditure trends."
