# Data

For our research, we leveraged datasets from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), specifically the Global Health Spending datasets covering the periods 1995 to 2019. This data is accessible through the following link: [Global Health Spending 1995 to 2019](https://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/global-health-spending-1995-2019). This dataset aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of health expenditure across diverse countries and regions. IHME, a renowned research institute, specializes in collecting and analyzing global health data, offering valuable insights into health trends and challenges.

The dataset offers a detailed breakdown of total health spending, categorizing expenditures by source (government, out-of-pocket, and prepaid private), and development assistance for health (DAH). To enhance usability, estimates are presented in constant 2021 United States Dollars, constant 2021 purchasing power parity adjusted (PPP) dollars, and as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP). This diverse set of metrics facilitates a nuanced analysis of health spending trends and their economic implications.

## Technical Description

**Data Format and Collection**

The data collection process involved multiple sources, with a primary focus on the World Health Organization’s Global Health Expenditure Database (GHED), a reputable repository compiling global health expenditure information. Additionally, data for development assistance for health (DAH) were sourced from various outlets, including program reports, budget data, national estimates, and National Health Accounts (NHAs). Domestic health spending sources, encompassing government, out-of-pocket, and prepaid private health spending, primarily relied on data from the WHO’s GHED. For countries not covered by GHED, information was extracted from respective country ministries of health or finance websites.

Assessment of GHED-extracted data reliability involved scrutinizing metadata provided by the World Health Organization (WHO). Utilizing natural language processing techniques, a data quality score ranging from 0 to 5 was assigned to each data point, considering metadata aspects such as reporting data source, data type, methods of estimation, and completeness. These quality scores informed the weighing of raw data, and a spatiotemporal Gaussian process model was applied to generate comprehensive time series estimates from 1995 to 2019 for each country. Additionally, 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were calculated to convey the range of potential values, accounting for inherent uncertainties. More details about the methodology can be found in the paper titled "Global investments in pandemic preparedness and COVID-19: development assistance and domestic spending on health between 1990 and 2026."

The dataset is structured in a tabular format, with each row representing a specific country or region and columns containing information on health spending metrics and related economic indicators. There are 79 indicators in total. The five primary variables—government health spending, out-of-pocket health spending, prepaid private health spending, and development assistance for health—all have mean values. Each of these variables is further stratified into subcategories, including per person, per total health spending, and per GDP. Additionally, the dataset provides values representing the lower and upper bounds for constant 2021 United States dollars, and lower and upper bounds for constant 2021 purchasing power parity power dollars, offering a comprehensive exploration of health spending dynamics across diverse metrics and dimensions.

This granularity enables a comprehensive examination of the financing landscape in the realm of global health. The inclusion of lower and upper bounds for each health spending metric, coupled with adjustments for inflation using country-specific exchange rates and the IMF World Economic Outlook database deflator series, reflects a commitment to methodological rigor and transparency.

By incorporating a range of values represented by lower and upper bounds, the dataset acknowledges the inherent uncertainty in economic and health expenditure forecasting. Economic conditions, currency exchange rates, and other external factors can introduce variability in health spending estimates. Therefore, providing a band of potential values serves as a safeguard against unforeseen fluctuations that may impact health spending trajectories.

The adjustment for inflation using country-specific exchange rates and IMF deflators is crucial for maintaining the temporal integrity of the dataset. It ensures that all spending estimates are expressed in a consistent and comparable unit (inflation-adjusted 2021 US dollars), allowing for meaningful analysis and interpretation across different time periods and geographic regions. This meticulous approach to data preparation enhances the dataset's reliability and utility, catering to the diverse needs of researchers, policymakers, and analysts in the field of global health economics.

This dual-column structure, with lower and upper values, signifies a commitment to precision and transparency in data presentation. The lower and upper values serve as bookends, delineating a plausible range for each metric and acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in health expenditure estimates. This approach enhances the dataset's reliability, providing users with nuanced insights into the potential variability of the reported values and promoting a more informed interpretation of global health spending trends.

Our approach involves interpreting the data from 2019 to uncover trends, shifts, and notable observations that can inform strategic decision-making and policy considerations in the realm of global health financing.


## Missing value analysis

As a whole, the data seems to be very clean. Upon thorough scrutiny of the data set, it becomes apparent that a singular column, the column titled "iso3," has missing data. This column had 100 missing values, while all the other columns had no missing information.

![](missing.jpg){width="65%"}

These missing values, however, are not indicative of a flaw or oversight but rather a deliberate design choice in alignment with the dataset's prescribed structure.The "iso3" column serves as a repository for three-letter country codes, crucial for country-specific identification. Upon closer inspection, it is discernible that certain rows within this column intentionally lack values. The rows that have missing is03 values correspond to values High income, Low income, Lower-middle income, and Upper-middle income in "location_name" column. This intentional omission is justified by consulting the dataset's documentation, where it is explicitly stated that these specific entries do not correspond to any particular country.

![](datadocumentation.jpg){width="65%"}

Instead, these instances are intended to encapsulate broader, non-country-specific information or aggregates that do not require a specific country code. In essence, the intentional missing values in the "iso3" column serve as placeholders for entries that transcend the bounds of individual countries, reflecting a nuanced data structure designed to accommodate diverse information categories within the dataset.

That being said, after taking a closer look at the data, we noticed that there are "-" or O inserted as some values.

Those columns that have missing values and how many there are are:

Below are two bar graphs with this information illustrated.

![](dash.jpg){width="100%"}
![](zero.jpg){width="100%"}

Our exploration into the dataset revealed a notable presence of missing values, primarily indicated by either a dash ("-") or a zero (0). To systematically address this issue, we adopted a meticulous approach wherein we examined the consistency of missing values for each country across different years. Remarkably, we observed variations in the extent of missing data for certain countries, leading us to recognize the importance of treating missing values on a need-to-know basis.

Recognizing the significance of preserving data integrity, we opted for a cautious strategy rather than employing imputation techniques. Given the structure of the dataset, with each country represented by 25 rows (corresponding to years), we carefully considered the potential implications of missing data. Instead of imputing values, we made a strategic decision to convert missing values, represented by dashes ("-") or zeros, into zeros. This decision was grounded in the understanding that genuine health expenditure values for any country are unlikely to be zero and eliminates the risk of misinterpretation associated with imputed values. By adopting this approach, we aimed to ensure transparency and accuracy in our analyses while mitigating the impact of missing values on the overall exploration.
