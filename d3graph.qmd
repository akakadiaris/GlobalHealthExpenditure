<p>The presented graph illustrates the trends in health expenditure from 1995 to 2019, focusing on three key variables: Government Health Spending per person (in constant 2021 United States dollars), Prepaid Private Health Spending per person (in constant 2021 United States dollars), and Out-of-pocket Health Spending per person (in constant 2021 United States dollars). The graph employs a color-coded scheme, with government spending depicted in green, out-of-pocket spending in orange, and prepaid private spending in purple. Stacked bar charts provide a visual representation of how these financing sources contribute to overall health expenditure over the specified years.

To enhance your analysis, a dropdown menu is available for selecting a specific region of interest, allowing for a more focused examination of health spending patterns in a particular geographic area.</p>
