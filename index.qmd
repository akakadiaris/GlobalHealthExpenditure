# Introduction

The allocation and trends in health spending wield profound implications for the well-being of nations. Timely and accurate information on health expenditure is crucial for preparing and responding to health emergencies, including pandemics. It enables countries and international organizations to allocate resources strategically, strengthen healthcare infrastructure, and enhance preparedness measures. This information is also vital for assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of health services, identifying areas for improvement, and achieving better health outcomes. Finally, estimates of future health spending can be beneficial for policymakers and planners and can identify financing gaps. 

This project delves into the realm of visualizing and comprehending the dynamics of Global Health Spendingâ€”a subject of paramount importance often obscured in the complexity of its vast dataset. The decision to explore this topic is rooted in the imperative to unravel patterns, disparities, and trends shaping how countries invest in the health and well-being of their populations. To do so, we leverage a comprehensive dataset containing health expenditure data for 204 countries from 1995 to 2019, produced by the Global Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network. This dataset encompasses a myriad of components, from government contributions and out-of-pocket expenses to development assistance and prepaid private financing. This holistic perspective on health spending transcends individual borders, offering insights into the global landscape of healthcare economics. 

The questions propelling this inquiry are as diverse as the facets of health spending itself. Seeking to bring clarity to this complexity, this research aims to address critical queries that traverse the temporal, geographical, financial source and future dimensions of health expenditure. Therefore, we will focus on the following three themes: Trends in Global Health Spending Over Time, Geographic Disparities, and Health Spending by Financing Source.

**Trends in Global Health Spending Over Time**

The first trajectory of inquiry delves into the temporal evolution of global health spending, exploring changes from 1995 to 2019. Questions arise: Are there discernible trends or patterns in health spending over this span of time? How has total global health spending transformed, and what insights can be gleaned from the observed trends? Another avenue we explore is investigating the impact of major global events (e.g., pandemics) on health spending across different regions. Can patterns or anomalies be identified in health spending during significant events, providing valuable insights into global healthcare resilience?

**Geographic Disparities**

A second avenue of exploration navigates the disparities in health spending across diverse regions or continents. This prompts an examination of variations: Do certain regions consistently outpace others in health spending? Are there observable disparities that unveil regional predilections in healthcare investment? How do low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries compare in terms of health spending trends over time?

**Health Spending by Financing Source**

Moving further, the research scrutinizes the sources fueling health spending. How much comes from government allocations, out-of-pocket expenses, and prepaid private sources? How have these proportions changed globally over time? We aim to paint a nuanced picture of the financial architecture sustaining healthcare systems.

In summary, this research endeavors to narrow the divide between raw data and nuanced comprehension, cultivating a holistic perspective on the determinants shaping investments in inclusive and enduring health systems on a global scale. Our intent is to pinpoint critical areas where the health economy may exhibit vulnerabilities in the face of potential forthcoming global challenges. Emphasizing the significance of meticulously tracking health expenditure, we illuminate anticipated challenges on the horizon.
