In this project, we undertake a thorough exploration of global health expenditure trends using data from the Global Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network. Covering retrospective estimates from 1995 to 2019 and prospective projections from 2020 to 2050, the dataset provides a rich source for investigating diverse facets of health spending. Our objective is to discover insights that contribute to the global discourse on health financing and inform evidence-based policy making.
